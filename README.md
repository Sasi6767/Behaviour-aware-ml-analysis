# Behaviour-Aware Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict behavioural
overstimulation using lifestyle, psychological, and digital engagement features.
The work demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, including data
preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

## Dataset
- **overstimulation_dataset.csv**  
  Contains behavioural, lifestyle, and psychological attributes used for model
  development and evaluation.

## Methods
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering and variable transformation
- Supervised machine learning models
- Model evaluation using train–test split and cross-validation
- Interpretation of key predictive factors

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- pandas, numpy  
- scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Project Structure
- **Behaviour_prediction_ml.ipynb** – Main machine learning analysis and results  
- **overstimulation_dataset.csv** – Dataset used for modelling  
- **README.md** – Project overview and documentation  

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook (`.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab  
2. Ensure required Python libraries are installed  
3. Run all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis  

## Notes
This project was completed as part of an academic machine learning module and has
been adapted for portfolio presentation.
